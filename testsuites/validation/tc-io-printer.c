 *
 *   - Check that rtems_printf() returns zero for the empty printer.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_vprintf() returns zero for the NULL printer.
 *
 * - Validate the printer directives while using a valid printer.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_printf() returns the expected value.
 *
 *   - Check that the printer was called exactly once.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_vprintf() returns the expected value.
 *
 *   - Check that the printer was called exactly once.
