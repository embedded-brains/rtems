 * @brief Tests the processing order of per-processor jobs.
 *
 * This test case performs the following actions:
 *
 * - Issue two jobs on the current processor with interrupts disabled.  Wait
 *   for completion of the second job.
 *
 *   - Check that the first job was processed firstly.
 *
 *   - Check that the second job was processed secondly.
 *
 * - Actions were performed by
 *   __wrap__SMP_Start_multitasking_on_secondary_processor().
 *
 *   - Check that the unicast action was performed while the worker processor
 *     is in the initial state.  Check that the counter was incremented exactly
 *     once by the boot processor while it is waiting for the other online
 *     processors to get ready for start multiprocessing.
