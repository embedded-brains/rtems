 *     of the counter. This shows that rtems_record_context provided the
 *     storage of the record context.
 *
 *   - Check that the items which rtems_record_add() appended were invisible to
 *     rtems_record_fetch() before the commit.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_commit() made the items visible to
 *     rtems_record_fetch() and restored the interrupt level.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_add() appended the items with the time stamp of
 *     the record context, the event, and the event data.
 *
 * - Disable the maskable interrupts. Prepare a record context with
 *   rtems_record_prepare_critical() for the processor with the highest index.
 *   Add an item with rtems_record_add(). Fetch the items of the processor.
 *   Commit the record context with rtems_record_commit_critical(). Fetch the
 *   items of the processor again. Enable the maskable interrupts.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_prepare_critical() initialized the record
 *     context with the record buffer of the processor and the time stamp of
 *     the counter.
 *
 *   - Check that the item which rtems_record_add() appended was invisible to
 *     rtems_record_fetch() before the commit.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_commit_critical() made the item visible to
 *     rtems_record_fetch() and left the maskable interrupts disabled.
 *
 * - Get the record buffer of each configured processor. Disable the maskable
 *   interrupts. Produce three items more than the capacity of the record
 *   buffer of the current processor. Copy the record buffer. Enable the
 *   maskable interrupts.
 *
 *   - Check that each configured processor has a record buffer of its own with
 *     a capacity of CONFIGURE_RECORD_PER_PROCESSOR_ITEMS items.
 *
 *   - Check that the record buffer contains the last items in the order of
 *     their production. The first three items replaced the oldest items of the
 *     full record buffer.
 *
 * - Produce an item in the record buffer of the processor with index zero.
 *   Fill a record fetch control with a pattern and initialize it with
 *   rtems_record_fetch_initialize(). Fetch the items.
 *
 *   - Check that the call of rtems_record_fetch() fetched the item of the
 *     processor with index zero into the array of the record fetch control.
 *     This shows that rtems_record_fetch_control provided the storage of the
 *     record fetch control.
 *
 * - Get the item count for a fetch with
 *   rtems_record_get_item_count_for_fetch(). Fill the record buffer of the
 *   processor with index zero beyond its capacity. Fetch the items with this
 *   item count. Fill the record buffer again. Fetch the items with the item
 *   count minus one.
 *
 *   - Check that one fetch with the item count fetched all items of the record
 *     buffer. Check that one fetch with the item count minus one left items in
 *     the record buffer.
 *
 * - Produce three items in the record buffer of the current processor. Call
 *   rtems_record_dump() with a handler which collects the output.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_dump() called the handler with the argument.
 *
 *   - Check that the output starts with the stream header.
 *
 *   - Check the content of the stream header.
 *
 *   - Check that the thread names follow the stream header. The name of the
 *     runner has more than 31 characters, so the output holds its first 31
 *     characters in more than one item.
 *
 *   - Check that the fetched items of all processors follow the thread names.
 *
 * - Produce three items in the record buffer of the current processor. Call
 *   rtems_record_dump_base64() with a handler which collects the output.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_dump_base64() output a newline character after
 *     each 76 characters.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_dump_base64() called the handler with the
 *     argument and output the base64 encoding of the data of
 *     rtems_record_dump().
 *
 * - Get the text of each enumerator of rtems_record_event with
 *   rtems_record_event_text().
 *
 *   - Check that the text is the name of the enumerator without the
 *     `RTEMS_RECORD_` prefix.
 *
 * - Evaluate the constants of the event recording.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_EVENT_BITS.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_TIME_BITS.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_THE_VERSION.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_MAGIC.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_FORMAT_BE_32.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_FORMAT_BE_64.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_FORMAT_LE_32.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_FORMAT_LE_64.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_LAST.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_NO_TIME_LAST.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_EMPTY.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_CONNECT_ENTRY.
 *
 *   - Check the value of RTEMS_RECORD_USER_511.
 *
 * - Evaluate the macros of the event recording.
 *
 *   - Check that RTEMS_RECORD_TIME_EVENT() evaluated to the time event with
 *     the time stamp in the upper bits and the event in the lower bits.
 *
 *   - Check that RTEMS_RECORD_GET_TIME() evaluates to the time stamp of the
 *     time event.
 *
 *   - Check that RTEMS_RECORD_GET_EVENT() evaluates to the event of the time
 *     event.
 *
 *   - Check that RTEMS_RECORD_USER() evaluates to the user event of the index.
 *
 * - Evaluate the types of the event recording.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_data is an unsigned integer type which can hold
 *     a value of the type `uintptr_t`.
 *
 *   - Check the members and the layout of rtems_record_item.
 *
 *   - Check the members and the layout of rtems_record_item_32.
 *
 *   - Check the members and the layout of rtems_record_item_64.
 *
 *   - Check that rtems_record_dump_chunk is a pointer to a function with the
 *     specified parameters which returns no value.
 *
 *   - Check that the enumerators of rtems_record_fetch_status have distinct
 *     values.
 *
 * - Get the items which the system produced during the initialization of the
 *   device drivers.
 *
 *   - Check that the system produced the uptime items with an uptime between
 *     the uptimes before and after the production.
 *
 * - Insert the uptime watchdogs again. Wait for two times the specified
 *   interval of the periodic uptime items plus two clock ticks. Remove the
 *   uptime watchdogs. Fetch the items of each processor.
 *
 *   - Check that each processor produced at least two uptime item pairs. Check
 *     that the uptimes of consecutive pairs differ by the specified interval.
